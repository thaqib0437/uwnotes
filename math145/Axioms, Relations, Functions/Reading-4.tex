\section{Axioms of Existence and Exensionality}

\begin{axm}{Axiom of Existence}{Axiom1} There is a set containing no elements. For this set set $A$ the statement $X\in A$ is false for all sets $X$.
\end{axm}

\begin{axm}{Axiom of Extensionality}{Axiom2}
If two sets have the same elements then they are equal. In other words for sets $X,Y$ if $\forall x \in X : x\in Y$ and $\forall y\in Y : y\in X$ then $X=Y$. 
\end{axm}
This axiom useful in proving uniqueness of sets. A theorem that can be proved using these 2 axioms is:
\begin{thm}{Unique Empty set}{}
There is a unique set containing no elements. (Denoted by ($\emptyset$))
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
The axiom of existence tells that a set with no elements exists. Assume we have 2 sets $A_1$ and $A_2$, each with no elements.  The statement $\forall a \in A_1 \Rightarrow a \in A_2$ is true (\textit{vacuously}). So each element of $A_1$ is an element of $A_2$, As $A_2$ is also empty. Similar argument follows. Therefore by \textit{axiom 2 (Exensionality)} $A_1 = A_2$. Therefore the empty set is unique. 
\end{proof}
\section{Comprehension}
This axioms captures the intuition that we should be able to define a set with certain properties without getting into \textit{Russell's paradox. } \\
\textbf{Russell's paradox}
Let us define a set $S$ with the following property:
\[S = \{X \; | \; X\notin X\}\]
This set is a set of sets that are not elements of themselves. The paradox arises when we ask $S\in S\;?$.\linebreak 
If $S\in S$ by definition of$S$ we have $S\notin S$ which is a contradiction. But now that we have $S\notin S$ then  by definition of $S$ we must have $S\in S$. This leads to a paradox.  The figure below shows the paradox. 

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[
roundnode/.style={circle, draw=green!60, fill=green!5, very thick, minimum size=7mm},
squarednode/.style={rectangle, draw=red!60, fill=red!5, very thick, minimum size=5mm},
]
%Nodes
\node[squarednode]      (maintopic)                              {$S\notin S$};
\node[roundnode]        (uppercircle)       [left=of maintopic] {$S\in S$};
\node[roundnode]      (rightsquare)       [right=of maintopic] {$S\in S$};
\node[squarednode]        (lowercircle)       [below=of maintopic] {$S\notin S$};

%Lines
\draw[->] (uppercircle.east) -- (maintopic.west);
\draw[->] (maintopic.east) -- (rightsquare.west);
\draw[->] (rightsquare.south) .. controls +(down:7mm) and +(right:7mm) .. (lowercircle.east);
\draw[->] (lowercircle.west) .. controls +(left:7mm) .. (uppercircle.south);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
The way around such a paradox is to define a set only when the sets come from a set already known to exist.
 \newpage

\begin{axm}{Axiom Schema of Comprehension}{Axiom3}
\label{Axiom3}
 Let $P(X)$ be a property of sets. For any set $A$, there is a set $B$ defined by the property  that $X\in B$ if and only if $X\in A$ and the statement $P(X)$ is true for all $X$.
 \end{axm}
Once we show that the set $B$ defined by the property $P(X)$ and set $A$ is unique. We can use the set builder notation to denote this set. The set $B$ in the \textit{axiom schema } will be written as
\[\{X\in A : P(X)\}\]


\begin{thm}{Uniqueness of set in Axiom Schema of Comprehension}{}
$\;$\\
For every set $A$ and property $P(X)$ of sets, the set $B$ defined by $A$ and $P(X)$ in (Axiom 3) is \textit{unique}. 
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
By  \hyperref[Axiom3]{Axiom 3} we know that such a set exists. We need to prove uniqueness. Let $B_1$ and $B_2$ be 2 sets defined by the property that set $X$ is in these sets if and only if $X\in A$ and $P(X)$ is true. \\
So according to the definition any $X\in B_1$ also implies $X\in B_2$ by axiom of Exensionality we have $B_1 = B_2$. So the set $B$ given the axiom schema of comprehension is \textit{unique}. 
\end{proof}

\section{Pair, Union and Power Set}

\begin{axm}{Axiom of Pair}{}
 Given sets $A$ and $B$, there is a set $C$ whose elements are exactly $A$ and $B$. In other words we have $X\in C$ if and only if $X=A$ or $X=B$. 
\end{axm}
We can also show this set $C$ is unique by axiom of Exensionality. 
\begin{proof}
Let sets $C_1$ and $C_2$ be defined as $X\in C_1, C_2$ if and only if $X = A$ or $X=B$ for sets $A,B$. By definition we have,  for each $X\in C_1$ we have $X\in C_2$. Then by axiom of Exensionality we have $C_1 = C_2$
\end{proof}
We will use the notation $\{A,B\}$ for the set containing $A,B$ and in case $A=B$ we write $\{A\}$\\
The next axiom allows us to create larger sets from smaller ones.\\
 
 \newpage

 \begin{axm}{Axiom of Union}{}
 For any set $S$ there exists a set $U$ such that for any set $X$, $X\in U$ if and only if $X\in A$ for some $A\in S$. \end{axm}
Using this axiom we being with a set $S$ and use it to construct $U$, which will represent the union of all elements in $S$ (each element of $S$ is a set). A set belongs to the union $U$ exactly when it belongs to some member of $S$. \\
We can use Axiom of Extensionality to show that $U$ is unique for a given set $S$. The notation used for this is:
 \[\bigcup S\]
Represents the union of all elements of $S$. For example $\bigcup \{\emptyset, \{\emptyset\}\} = \{\emptyset\}$. As our definition states $x\in U$ if and only if $x\in A$ for some $A\in S$. We use the notation $A\cup B$ to represent $\bigcup\{A,B\}$

\begin{axm}{Axiom of power set}{}
For any set $A$, there exists a set $\mathcal{P}$, such that for any set $X, \; X\in \mathcal{P}$ if and only if $X\subseteq A$. 
\end{axm}
We can show the uniqueness using another axioms. The notation $\mathcal{P}(A)$ is used to denote the power set of $A$.  
Examples $\mathcal{P}(\{x_1, x_2\}) = \{\emptyset, \{x_1\}, \{x_2\}, \{x_1, x_2\}\}$. So in general for any set $A$ and the empty set $\emptyset$ are both subsets of $A$ so both are in $\mathcal{P(}A)$. \\


\textbf{Set Constructions}
Some of the common set constructions using axioms are:
\begin{itemize}
\item[\#] $A\cap B$, This can be constructed using \hyperref[Axiom3]{Axiom 3}. We define it as following: 
\[A\cap B = \{x\in A : x\in B\}\]
\item[\#] $A\setminus B$, This can also be constructed using axiom of comprehension.  
\[A\setminus B = \{x\in A : x \notin B\}\]
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\section{Natural Numbers and Successors}
We define natural numbers by the following property, every natural number $n$ is a set with exactly $n$ elements. As $\varnothing$ has no elements, it forces us to choose $0 = \varnothing$.\\
For sets with one element, all these sets have a single element: $\{\emptyset\}$, $\{\{\emptyset, \{\emptyset\}\}\}$, and $\{\{\emptyset\}\}$. More generally, for any set $x$, the set $\{x\}$ has one element. 
\\
One natural way to proceed is to define natural numbers based on the previously defined natural numbers. So $1 = \{0\}$, and $2 = \{1,0\}$ and so on. This leads to the recursive definition of a natural number $n$:
\[n = \{0,1,2, \ldots n-1\}\].\\
Another way to define a number $n+1$ (given numbers until $n$ are defined) is
\[n+1 = n \cup \{n\}\] 
Since the elements of $n+1$ are exactly the elements of $\{n\}$ and $n$ itself. 

\begin{defn}{Successor}{}
For any set $x$, the \textit{successor} of $x$ is the set $S(x) = x\cup \{x\}$
\end{defn}
So the natural numbers are what we get by applying successor to the empty set a finite number of times. 
\subsection{Inductive Sets and the Axiom of Infinity}
until now we do not have a way of explicitly defining the natural numbers based on the axioms we have so far. For this we need to define \textit{inductive set}
\begin{defn}{Inductive set}{}
A set $I$ is called \textit{inductive} if it has the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $0\in I$. 
\item if $n \in I$, then $S(n) \in I$
\end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

\newpage

\begin{axm}{Axiom of infinity}{} An inductive set exists. \end{axm}


Using this definition we can build $\mathbb{N}$. We let $\mathcal{I}$ to be the set said to exist by axiom of infinity, and use axiom of comprehension we have:
\[\mathbb{N} = \{x\in \mathcal{I} : x\in I \text{ for all inductive sets } I\}\]
\begin{thm}{}{}
$\mathbb{N}$ is \textit{inductive}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
We to justify the 2 properties of inductive sets. First, $0\in \mathbb{N}$, for every inductive set $I$ $0\in I$ by definition. Now assume that an element $n\in \mathbb{N}$, then by definition we have $n \in I$, for each such set $I$ we know that $n+1 \in I$. As $n+1$ belongs to every inductive set, hence it belongs to $\mathbb{N}$ as well.  
\end{proof}
To complete the construction of natural numbers we define a way to order the natural numbers. 
\begin{defn}{Ordering on $\mathbb{N}$}{}
Let $m,n \in \mathbb{N}$. We say that $m < n $ if $m \in n$
\end{defn}





\section{Ordered Pairs, Relations, and Cartesian Products}
\subsection{Ordered Pairs}
An ordered paid $(x,y)$ as the name suggest is ordered unlike sets. So an ordered paid $(x,y) \neq (y,x)$ the ordering of the elements matter. We can only have 2 ordered pairs equal $(x,y) = (x^\prime, y^\prime) \iff x = x^\prime\quad y = y^\prime$. \\
\begin{defn}{Ordered pair}{}
Given any 2 sets $x$ and $y$, the \textit{ordered paid} $(x,y)$ is defined to be the set \[\{\{x\}, \{x,y\}\}\]
\end{defn}\newpage
\begin{thm}{Uniqueness of ordered pairs}{}
For any sets $x,y,x_1, y_1$ we have $(x,y) = (x_1, y_1)$ if and only if $x = x_1$ and $y = y_1$. 
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
($\Leftarrow$)\\
Assume $x = x_1$ and $y = y_1$
Then we have:
\begin{align*}
(x,y) = \{\{x\}, \{x,y\}\}\\
= \{\{x_1\}, \{x_1,y_1\}\}\\
= (x_1, y_1)
\end{align*}
($\Rightarrow$)
Now assume that $(x,y) = (x_1, y_1)$ due to the assumption we have
\[\{\{x\}, \{x,y\}\} = \{\{x_1\}, \{x_1,y_1\}\}\]
By axiom of Extensionality, 2 sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Case 1: $x = y$
Then we have $\{\{x\}, \{x,y\}\} =  \{\{x\}\}$ by the above equality we must have $\{x\} = \{x_1\} \iff x = x_1$, and $\{x_1, y_1\} = \{x\}$ this is true if and only if $x = x_1$ and $x = y_1  = y$. There we have established $x = x_1$ and $y = y_1$
\item Case 2: $x \neq y$
Given the equality above $\{x,y\} = \{x_1\}$ is impossible then we must have $\{x,y\} = \{x_1, y_1\}$. Then it must be the case that $\{x\} = \{x_1\} \iff x = x_1$. 
\[\{x,y\} = \{x_1, y_1\} = \{x,y_1\}\]
Then we must have $y_1 = y$ this completes the proof. 
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}


\newpage
\subsection{Cartesian Products}
Informally the product of 2 sets $X\times Y$ is the collection of all ordered pairs. With first coordinate from $X$ and second from $Y$. In order to construct this product we need to supply a set with all elements of $X\times Y$. This can be defined as
\[X\times Y = \{w\in Z : w = (x,y) \text{ for some } x\in X, y\in Y\}\]   
The problem is what is this set $Z$?\\
First we need a set that contains the elements of $X$ and $Y$ this can be done with axiom of union. By constructing $X\cup Y$. Certainly $\{x\}$ and $\{x,y\}$ are both subsets of $X\cup Y$. So the elements of the set $\{x, \{x,y\}\}$ can be taken to belong to the power set $\mathcal{P(}X\cup Y)$\\
Now we have $\{x\} \in $ $\mathcal{P(}X\cup Y)$ and $\{x,y\} \in\mathcal{P(}X\cup Y)$. but the set $\{x, \{x,y\}\}$ is not a subset of $X\times Y$ so we cannot take $ Z = \mathcal{P(}X\cup Y)$. \\
To get a set of \textit{subsets} of $\mathcal{P(}X\cup Y)$ we need to consider the power set of this set. We need an element of $\mathcal{P(}\mathcal{P(}X\cup Y))$. As $\{\{x\}, \{x,y\}\} \in \mathcal{P(}\mathcal{P(}X\cup Y))$. So we can take $Z = \mathcal{P(}\mathcal{P(}X\cup Y))$ The formal definition is :
\begin{defn}{Product of sets}{}
Given any two sets $X$ and $Y$ , the Cartesian product of $X$ and $Y$ is the set
\[X\times Y = \{w\in \mathcal{P(}\mathcal{P(}X\cup Y)) \;:\; w = (x,y) \text{ for some } x\in X, y\in Y\}\]
\end{defn}

\subsection{Relations and Functions}
\begin{defn}{Binary Relation}{}
Given 2 sets a $A$, $B$ \textit{binary} relation from $A$ to $B$ is a subset of $A\times B$. More generally a set $R$ is called a \textit{relation} if all the elements of $R$ are ordered pairs. Rather than writing $(x,y) \in R$ we write $xRy$.
\end{defn}
\begin{defn}{Function}{}
A \textit{function} is a relation such if $(a,b_1)$ and $(a, b_2)$ in $f$ then we must have $b_1 = b_2$. If $(a,b)\in f$ we write $f(a) = b$ 
\end{defn}
A function from the set $A$ to $B$ is denoted by 
\[f:A \rightarrow B\]
\newpage
\subsection{Terminology Around Relations and Functions}
\begin{defn}{Domain and Range}{}
The \textbf{domain} of the relation $R$ is the set of all such $x$ such that $(x,y)\in R$ for some $y$. \\
The \textbf{range} of $R$ is the set of all such $y$ such that $(x,y)\in R$ for some $x$. 
We use ran$(R)$ and dom$(R)$ to denote the domain and range of $R$. 
The set ran$(R)\cup$dom$(R)$ is called the \textbf{\textit{\emph{field}}} of $R$.  
\end{defn}
All these definitions also apply to functions. 
\begin{defn}{Image, Inverse Image}{}
Let $R$ be a binary relation. The \textit{image} of set $A$ under $R$ is the set
\[R(A) = \{b\in \text{ran}(R) : (a,b) \in R \text{ for some } a\in A\}\]
Similarly given set $B$ the \textit{inverse image} of $B$ under $R$ is defined as
\[R^{-1} (B) = \{a\in \text{dom$R$} : (a,b)\in R \text{ for some $a\in A$}\}\]
\end{defn}
Given 2 relations their composition $R_2\circ R_1$ is defined as:
\[R_2 \circ R_1 = \{z\in \text{ dom$(R_2)\times$ ran$(R_1)$}\} : z = (a,c) \text{ such that $\exists b (a,b) \in R_1$ and $(b,c)\in R_2$}\}\]

\section{Invertibility, Injectivity, and Surjectivity}
A function is called Injective if for all $x_1, x_2 \in $dom$f$ such that $x_1 \neq x_2$. We have $f(x_1) \neq f(x_2)$. \\

If a function from $A$ to $B$ is called Surjective (onto) if ran$(f) = B$. In other words, for each $b\in B$ there exits $a\in A$ such that $f(a) = b$. \\

A function is called a bijection if it is both injective and surjective.

\section{Equivalence Relations}

\begin{defn}{Equivalence relation}{}
Let $R$ be be a binary relation on set $A$.  We say that 
\begin{itemize}
\item $R$ is \textit{reflexive} if , for all $a\in R$, we have $aRa$
\item $R$ is \textit{symmetric} if , for all $a,b \in A$  if $aRb$ then $bRa$
\item $R$ is \textit{transitive} if , for all $a,b,c \in A$ if $aRb$ and $bRc$ then $aRc$. 
\item $R$ is an equivalence relation if $R$ is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. 
\end{itemize}
\end{defn}

\subsection{Equivalence Classes}
\begin{defn}{Equivalence Class}{}
Suppose that $E$ is an equivalence relation on some set $A$. Given an element $a\in A$ the equivalence class of $a$ modulo $E$ is the set
\[[a]_E = \{x\in A : aEx\}\]
\end{defn}
So a equivalence relation splits up a set $A$ into smaller equivalence classes.  For any 2 elements in $A$ their equivalence classes are identical or they are disjoint. 
\begin{thm}{}{}
Let $E$ be an equivalence relation on set $A$. 
\begin{itemize}
\item[(1)] We have $aEb$ if and only if $[a] = [b]$
\item[(2)] We have $(a,b) \notin E$ if and only if $[a]\cap [b] = \varnothing$
\end{itemize}
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
Assume that $aEb$. We have to prove that $[a] = [b]$. \\
Let $x\in [a]$ by definition we have $aEx$, since $E$ is symmetric and we know $aEb$ then $bEa$ as well. As $E$ is transitive and we have $bEa$ and $aEx$ this implies $bEx$. So we get $x\in [b]$ showing $[b] \subset [a]$ a symmetric argument for $[a] \subset [b]$ follows. Proving that $[a] = [b]$ is $aEb$. \\
 Next, assume $[a] = [b]$. Since $E$ is reflexive we know that $bEb$ so we have $b\in [b]$ but we have $[b] = [a]$ then we get $b\in [a]$ by definition we get $aEb$. 
 
 
We can prove $(2)$ if we have $[a] \cap [b] = \varnothing$ then $[a] \neq [b]$ because both $[a]$ and $[b]$ are non empty sets. On the other hand assume $[a] \cap [b] \neq \varnothing$. Then there is some $x \in [a] \cap [b]$ so we have $x \in [a]$ and $x\in [b]$. That is by definition $aEx$ and $bEx$ using the property of equivalence relations we can get to $aEb$. By part (1) we have $[a] = [b]$. 
\end{proof}




\newpage
\section{Partitions}
\begin{defn}{Partitions}{}
Given any set $A$, a \textit{partition} $\mathcal{P}$ of $A$ is a collection of  non empty sets with the properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(1)] For any two distinct sets $P_1, P_2 \in \mathcal{P}$, we have $P_1 \cap P_2 = \varnothing$
\item[(2)] $\bigcup \mathcal{P} = A$
\end{itemize}{} 
\end{defn}
Theorem 5 essentially shows that a every equivalence relation on $A$ gives us  a set $A$ gives us a partition of that set. We have the notation $A/E$ for the set $\{[a]_E : a \in A\}$.

\begin{thm}{}{}
Let $E$ be a equivalence relation on $A$. Then $A/E$ is a partition of $A$. 
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Every equivalence class $[a]$ is non empty as we must have $a \in [a]$. According to \textbf{lemma 1.1} if 2 equivalence classes are not equal they are disjoint. Which verifies condition (1) for partitions. Condition (2) follows from the fact that every $a\in A$ belongs to its equivalence class $[a]$, so the union of all equivalence classes $[a]$ is the set whole set $A$
\end{proof}
Therefore \emph{every equivalence relation gives rise to a partition.} We can also show that the converse is true: That every partition can be used to define an equivalence relation on that set. 
\newpage
\begin{thm}{}{}
Let $A$ be a set , and let $\mathcal{P}$ be a partition on that set. We define a relation $E$ on $A$ by stating $a_1 E a_2$ if there is some $P \in \mathcal{P}$ such that $a_1 \in P$ and $a_2 \in P$. Then $E$ is an equivalence relation on $A$. 
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
$\;$\\
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Reflexivity} Let $a\in A$ be arbitrary. Since $\mathcal{P}$ is a partition, there is some $P \in \mathcal{P}$ containing $a$. So clearly $a\in P$ and $a\in P$ then we have $aEa$ for every $a\in A$. 

\item \textbf{Symmetry} Suppose we have $a_1, a_2 \in A$ such that $a_1 E a_2$. There there is some $P \in \mathcal{P}$ such that $a_1 \in P$ and $a_2 \in P$. Symmetrically we also have $a_2 \in P$ and $a_1 \in P$ leading to $a_2 E a_1$

\item \textbf{Transitivity} Suppose we have $a_1, a_2, a_3 \in A$ such that $a_1Ea_2$ and $a_2Ea_3$. Then for some $P_1\in\mathcal{P}$ we have $a_1 \in P_1$ and $a_2 \in P_1$, and also for some $P_2 \in \mathcal{P}$ we have $a_2 \in P_2$ and $a_3 \in P_2$. Since $\mathcal{P}$ is a partition if $P_1$ and $P_2$ were distinct we would have $P_1 \cap P_2 = \varnothing$. But this is not the case as $a_2$ is in both sets. Therefore we have $P_1 = P_2$. So $a_1$ and $a_3$ are in the same $P_1 \in \mathcal{P}$ leading to $a_1 E a_3$ 

\end{itemize}
\end{proof} 
Therefore, we see that this correspondence runs both ways: every equivalence relation gives a partition, and every partition gives an equivalence relation.


\begin{defn}{}{}
Let $A$ be a set and $E$ be an equivalence relation on $A$.  A set $X$ is called the \textit{set of representatives} for $E$ if $X$ contains exactly one element from each equivalence class. \\
In other words, for each $[a] \in A/E$ we have $X\cup [a] = \{\alpha\}$ for some $\alpha \in [a]$. 
\end{defn}
These equivalence classes can be visualized using this figure:

\section{Order Relations}
\begin{defn}{Antisymmetric Relation}{}
Let $R$ be a binary relation on set $A$. We say that $R$ if, whenever we have $a,b \in A$ such that $aRb$ and $bRa$, it follows that $a=b$. A relation $\ord$ is an order relation on $A$ if if it is reflexive , \textit{antisymmetric}, and transitive.
\end{defn}
\subsection{Chains and Extremal Elements}
\begin{defn}{Total ordering}{}
If $\ord$ is a partial ordering on set $A$ we say that 2 elements $a,b \in A$ are comparable if either $a\ord b$ or $b \ord a$. A partial order in which every pair of elements is comparable is called a \textit{total ordering} or \textit{linear ordering}. \\
\end{defn}
{\color{red} Example} The relation $\leq$ on $\mathbb{Z}$ is a total ordering as every pair $a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$ are comparable. 

Another important notion which comes is the notion of a \textit{chain}:
\begin{defn}{Chain}{}
If $\ord$ is a partial order on set $A$, a subset $C$ of $A$ is called a \textit{chain} if every pair of $C$ are comparable. In particular, if $\ord$ is a total order on $A$ then $A$ itself is a chain in $A$. 
\end{defn}

Because not every element of a set must be comparable we have to be careful in distinguishing the greatest and the least elements of of a given set. The distinction is given by the following definitions. 
\begin{defn}{Maximal, minimal, greatest, least elements}{}
Let $A$ be a set with partial order relation $\ord$. Given a subset $B$ of $A$ we say that 
\begin{itemize}
\item An element $b\in B$ is the \textbf{least element} of $B$ if we have $b\ord b^\prime$ for all $b^\prime \in B$. Similarly, an element is the \textbf{greatest element} if $b^\prime \ord b$ for all $b^\prime\in B$. 

\item An element $b\in B$ is the \textbf{minimal element} of $B$ if there are no smaller elements, that is if $b^\prime \ord b$ \textbf{for some} $b^\prime \in B$ then $b = b^\prime$. Similarly an element is the \textbf{maximal element} if there are no larger elements, that is if $b \ord b^\prime$ \textbf{for some} $b^\prime \in B$ then $b^\prime = b$. 
\end{itemize}
\end{defn}

\newpage
\section{Bounds on Sets, Suprema, and Infima}
\begin{defn}{Bounds, Suprema, and Infima}{}
Suppose $A$ is a set with order relation $\ord$ and with a subset $B$. 
\begin{itemize}
\item An element $a\in A$ is a lower bound for $B$ if $a\ord b$ \textbf{for all} $b\in B$. Similarly $a\in A$ is a upper bound for $B$ if $b \ord a$ \textbf{for all} $b\in B$. 

\item An element $a\in A$ is the infimum (Greatest lower bound) of $B$ if $a$ is the greatest element of the set of al lower bounds for $B$. 

\item Am element $a\in A$ is the supremum (Least upper bound) of $B$ if $a$ is the least element of the set of all upper bounds for $B$. 
\\
If they exist, we use $sup\;B$ and $inf \;B$ to denote the supremum and infimum of a set $B$, respectively.
 
\end{itemize}
\end{defn}

\section{Axiom of choice}

Suppose $\mathcal{C}$ is a non empty collection of sets then the Cartesian product of all sets in $\mathcal{C}$ is written as:

\[\prod\limits_{C\in \mathcal{C}} C\] 

If $\mathcal{C}$ is an infinite collection of sets then we need infinite ordered tuple of elements. Then we need a function $\alpha : \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \bigcup \mathcal{C}$. Then for each $C\in \mathcal{C}$ we have $\alpha(C) \in C$. The function $\alpha (C)$ should give the $C$-th coordinate of the infinite tuple. We can formally define this as:\\

\begin{defn}{Cartesian Product for infinite sets}{}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ denote a non empty collection of sets. The Cartesian product $\prod\limits_{C\in \mathcal{C}}C$  is the set of all functions $\alpha : \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \bigcup \mathcal{C}$  with the property $\alpha(C) \in C$.
\end{defn} 

We can use this definition to redefine the Cartesian product, even for finitely many sets. We can define an ordered pair $(a,b) \in A\times B$ as $(\alpha(A), \alpha(B))\in A\times B$. \\
The problem arises when for an infinite number of sets in $\mathcal{C}$ we cannot show (using the standard axioms of set theory) that:

\[\prod_{C\in \mathcal{C}}C \neq \varnothing\]
For this we need a new axiom. 

\begin{axm}{Axiom of Choice}{}
The Cartesian product of any non-empty collection of non-empty sets is
non-empty.
\end{axm}
This axiom is also equivalent to the existence of a choice function for every non-empty collection of set $\mathcal{C}$.

\section{Zorn's Lemma and the Well-Ordering Theorem}

Another statement about partially ordered set is logically equivalent to Axiom of choice. 


\begin{thm}{Zorn's Lemma}{}
Let $A$ be a partially ordered set with order relation $\preceq$. Suppose that every chain in $A$ has an upper bound in $A$, then $A$ has a maximal element. 
\end{thm}


A Corollary that follows from Zorn's Lemma is:

\begin{coll}{}{}
Suppose that $A$ is a partially ordered set with order relation $\preceq$ then every chain $\mathcal{C}$ in $A$ is contained in a maximal chain $\mathcal{M}$. 
\end{coll}
\begin{proof}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ be an arbitrary chain in $A$. Consider the set $\Gamma$ of all chains $\mathcal{C}$ in $A$. The subset relation $\subseteq$ relation on $\mathcal{P}(A)$ giving the order relation between elements of $\Gamma$. Now suppose we have a chain $\mathcal{D}$ in the ordered set $\Gamma$. We can show that $\mathcal{D}$ is an upper bound in $\gamma$
\\

If we define $\mathcal{C}_0 = \bigcup \mathcal{D}$, the union of all the, clearly for each $\mathcal{C}^\prime \in \mathcal{D}$ we have $C^\prime \subseteq \mathcal{C}_0$. Since $C_0$ contains every chain of $\mathcal{D}$, each of which contains $\mathcal{C}$ we know that $\mathcal{C}_0$ contains $\mathcal{C}$. Therefore $C_0$ is an upper bound on $\mathcal{D}$ by definition. If we can verify $C_0 \in \Gamma $ that means $C_0$ is a chain in $A$
\\

Suppose we have  $a_1, a_2 \in \mathcal{C}_0$. By construction each element of $a_1$ and $a_2$ belong to a chain in $\mathcal{D}$, so we can write $a_1 \in \mathcal{C}_1$ and $a_2 \in \mathcal{C}_2$. Since $\mathcal{D}$ is a chain with respect to the relation $\subseteq$, we can either have $\mathcal{C}_1\subseteq \mathcal{C}_2$ or we can have $\mathcal{C}_2\subseteq \mathcal{C}_1$. Without loss of generality we say $\mathcal{C}_1\subseteq \mathcal{C}_2$ . Thus both $a_1, a_2 \in C_2$. Since $\mathcal{C}_2$ is a chain, the elements in $\mathcal{C}_2$ are comparable with $\preceq$, this verifies that $\mathcal{C}_0$ is a chain in $A$, as $C_0 \in \Gamma$. 
\\

Now if we apply Zorns lemma to $\Gamma$ which is ordered by $\subseteq$, there is a chain $\mathcal{M} \in \Gamma$, maximal with respect to the containment relation $\subseteq$. This is a chain in $A$ with respect to the ordering $\preceq$, as it is maximal with with respect to $\subseteq$ all chains $\mathcal{C}$ of $A$ are contained in $\mathcal{M}$ and it is not properly contained in any chain.  


\end{proof}




\newpage
The well ordering theorem is another statement known to be equivalent to axiom of choice. We can define the WOP of $\mathbb{N}$ more generally. 
\begin{defn}{Well ordering}{}
Suppose $A$ is a set with order relation $\preceq$. The ordered set $A$ is said to be well ordered if every non empty subset of $A$ has a least element with respect to the relation $\preceq$
\end{defn}

This leads to the well ordering theorem:

\begin{thm}{Well-Ordering Theorem}{}
Every non empty set has a well ordering. 
\end{thm}

In other words, if $A$ is a non empty set then there is a an order relation $\preceq$ on $A$, such that $A$ is well ordered with respect to $\preceq$. This means that the set $\mathbb{R}$ has as well ordering, not with respect to the relation $\leq$ as this fails for any open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ but according to \textit{well ordering theorem} there exits a relation $\preceq$ on $\mathbb{R}$ on which every subset of $\mathbb{R}$ will have a least element with respect to $\preceq$ which is not the relation $\leq$. 
\\

The 3 statements Axiom of choice, Well-Ordering Theorem, Zorn's Lemma are all logically equivalent.
